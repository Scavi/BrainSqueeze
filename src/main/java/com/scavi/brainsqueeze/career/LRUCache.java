 * Question:  https://www.careercup.com/question?id=4904590152564736
 * Design/Implement an LRU cache so that Read/Write/Find operation only takes constant time.
 * Now, Let's say, we will be considering the frequency as well. It means to keep the most used processes and in a
 * case of the tie, use lease recently used to remove an element. Now, as this new algorithm can cause many hits,
 * or no new process will come to the cache if the last process of the cache has two hits., What can you do to prevent
 * this, and how would you implement that.
